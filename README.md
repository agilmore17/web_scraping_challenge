# web_scraping_challenge
11th Challenge for UofR's data analytics bootcamp

All Code was sourced by me, by looking back at old assignments to remember some of the methods for Matplotlib.

Web scraping and automation was eaier in practice than it was in the class, so much so that I felt like I was forgetting to do something, so hopfully everything works smoothly.

The only thing I want to make note of is that the pathing for Chromedriver may have to be changed slightly since I had to use an alternate method to get it to properly read the .exe file.
